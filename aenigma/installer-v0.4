echo
echo "XMPP works a little bit like email. You can have a domain [amsterdamhacklab.xyz] and receive email for that domain on a server located at mx01.amsterdamhacklab.xyz, by using the appropriate DNS configuration, and also have other servers [webserver, mapserver, etc...] on other subdomains. In that case, a DNS "MX" record tells sending servers to direct mail intended for amsterdamhacklab.xyz to mx01.amsterdamhacklab.xyz."
echo
echo "In the same way, the XMPP server for amsterdamhacklab.xyz can be located at xmpp.amsterdamhacklab.xyz and a DNS "SRV" record tells any sending servers that XMPP for that domain [i.e. a message directed to mark@amsterdamhacklab.xyz] is handled by the server located at xmpp.amsterdamhacklab.xyz."
