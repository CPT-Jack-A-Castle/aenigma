# aenigma

**aenigma** provisions a **fully functional** and **secure** out of the box **XMPP server** you can get running today.

It does for XMPP what [Mail-in-a-Box](https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox) has done for email, [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand) for VPNs, and [Easyengine](https://easyengine.io/) for wordpress.

The installation takes you on a three-minute, clearly worded, step-by-step setup and takes care of everything automagically.

As soon as you're up and running join our conference at os@xc.os.vu !

## Features

* **State of the art configuration** [work in progress ;]
* **Secure by default** [see [non-features](#non-features) for backwards compatibility exceptions]
* **One touch deployment**: install it in three minutes with two commands!
* Has a guided, **step-by-step install** that makes sure you get everything perfect on the first run
* Always based on the **latest version of ejabberd**, a modern, scalable, and robust XMPP server
* Passes all of the **compliance checks** performed by the Conversations client <sup>[1](#01)
* Passes all of the ejabberd-supported [XEP-0375 compliance checks](https://github.com/iNPUTmice/ComplianceTester) <sup>[2](#02)
* Allows you to and guides you through using your **top level domain as the xmpp domain [@example.im]** while hosting the server on a subdomain [xmpp.example.im] as its hostname by using SRV records without any XMPP client UI/UX or TLS conflicts.
* Works perfectly for both internet accessible and local network deployments
* **Supports IPv6** out of the box
* **Validates all required IPv4 and IPv6 DNS settings** [even those for specific modules such as `pubsub.`] and tells you exactly the correct values for every record
* Sets up **UFW rules** for all configured services
* Provisions **free and fully valid TLS [SSL] certificates** for everything [ejabberd and web] thanks to LetsEncrypt
* Installs nginx and makes the ejabberd **web admin interface securely available** at https://[hostname]
* Easily allows for the website for your top level domain to be hosted on the same server as well
* Listens for **XMPP c2s [aka client to server] and SSH connections *also* on port 443** [thanks to SSLH] to allow XMPP clients and administrative workstations behind restrictive firewalls to connect without the need to circumvent the firewall with VPNs or Tor
* Natively supports **Signal-level encrypted conversations** with all the required modules for **OMEMO E2EE**
* Configures ejabberd **Shared Roster Groups** to easily allow the desired users to see eachother on their own rosters

##### 01

Although Conversations says PEP [Avatars / OMEMO] is *not* supported, it actually is, and both work perfectly

##### 02

Not yet supported by ejabberd:

* XEP-0357: Push Notifications
* XEP-0368: SRV records for XMPP over TLS [should start working soon thanks to ejabberd v17.09]
* XEP-0384: OMEMO Encryption [even though OMEMO works perfectly]

## Non-features

* Keeps backwards compatibility with legacy XMPP servers by using a not very restrictive ciphersuite for s2s [aka server to server] connections, but you can enable the latest ciphers suggested by cipherli.st [although not recommended] by changing two lines in the config file.
