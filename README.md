![aenigma logo](logo/aenigma_logo.png?raw=true)

**aenigma** provisions a **fully functional** and **secure-out-of-the-box** **XMPP server** you can get running today.

It does for XMPP what [Mail-in-a-Box](https://github.com/mail-in-a-box/mailinabox) has done for email, [Streisand](https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand) for VPNs, and [Easyengine](https://easyengine.io/) for wordpress / nginx sites hosting.

The installation takes you on a 15 minute, clearly worded, step-by-step setup and takes care of everything automagically.

All of the features offered by our project and the related installation instructions are detailed below.

## The openspace instance of aenigma

Take a look at our actual running instance of aenigma - operated by our hackerspace [openspace](https://openspace.xxx) - by registering a forever free account **@os.vu**.

You can register your account right now by specifying a `your-user@os.vu` JID [jabber user ID] during the new account creation fase [offered by virtually all XMPP apps] and dive right into this amazing world!

As soon as you're up and running join our group chat at xmpp:aenigma@xc.os.vu !

## Support the project

You can now become a Patreon supporter of the project starting at only $1/month, and access our priority support, custom features rapid development requests [then made available for eveyone of course], and help ensure that aenigma is always on the bleeding edge of features offered by ejabberd and the XMPP world. Help us out and join our Patreon community [here](https://www.patreon.com/aenigma_xmpp). Thank you in advance!

## Features

* **state of the art configuration** always updated with the latest functionalities and best practices for every ejabberd version
* **latest and most robust security by default** in addition to a built-in first-boot system-wide hardening script
* **one touch deployment**: just clone and run the setup script on one or multiple freshly installed machines
* features a **simple, clear, step-by-step installer** that makes sure you get everything perfect on the first run
* always based on the **latest version of ejabberd**, a modern, scalable, and robust XMPP server [thanks to the jabber.at APT repository that allows your system to keep ejabberd up to date independently of aenigma]
* provisions **100% compliant servers** by passing all of the [2018 XEP-0387 compliance checks](https://compliance.conversations.im/about/) and therefore those performed by the Conversations client
* natively supports **[almost] signal-level encrypted conversations** with all the required modules for **OMEMO E2EE**
* allows you to and guides you through using your **top level domain as the xmpp domain [@domain.xyz]** while hosting the server on a subdomain [xmpp.domain.xyz] as its hostname by using SRV records [without any XMPP client UI/UX complications or TLS conflicts]
* **fully supports IPv6** out of the box meaning your client applications could hypothetically work on IPv6-only networks
* listens for all of the required **XMPP c2s [client to server], HTTP_uploads, and SSH connections *also* on port 443** [thanks to SSLH] to allow XMPP clients and administrative workstations behind restrictive firewalls to connect without the need to circumvent the firewall with VPNs or Tor [and sets SRV records for XMPP over TLS (XEP-0368) so that clients can find this server capability autonomously and automatically]
* **validates all required IPv4 and IPv6 DNS settings including SRV records** [even those for specific modules such as pubsub] and tells you exactly the correct values for each record [work in progress: automatic DNS provisioning via API]
* sets up the **system firewall and UFW rules** for all configured services
* installs nginx and makes the ejabberd **web admin interface securely available** at `https://[hostname]`
* provisions and automatically renews **free and fully valid LetsEncrypt wildcard TLS [SSL] certificates** and correctly configures all deployed services [ejabberd, nginx, etc...] accordingly
* creates ejabberd **Shared Roster Groups** to easily allow admins to see all users registered on their own rosters and all users online at any given time
* automatically **backups up** all configuration, the ejabberd database, and XMPP data storage **locally and [optionally] to S3 with strong encryption** via duplicity and includes a script for a **guided, consistent, and complete restore**
* allows you to easily run your aenigma instance on **multiple servers [a cluster]** for **robustness, load distribution / balancing, and failover**
* **idempotent and self-versioning** to allow for easy re-installs, re-configurations, and upgrades

## Non-features

* Keeps backwards compatibility with other, older, not 100% compliant, XMPP servers out there by using a not very restrictive ciphersuite for s2s [aka server to server] connections, but you can break all bridges with the rest of the world and enable the latest ciphers suggested by cipherli.st [although really not recommended] by changing two lines in the config file

## Future features

* New and improved backup / restore logic that is cluster-aware and more robust when handling unusual user-level situations [[Patreon $16/month goal](https://www.patreon.com/aenigma_xmpp)]

* Automated DNS record provisioning on any nameserver backend that has an API access [CloudFlare, mail-in-a-box, etc...] [[Patreon $24/month goal](https://www.patreon.com/aenigma_xmpp)]

* Complete and total re-write of our synthia+dna framework [currently entirely in bash] into a fully modern and professional codebase designed with a modular and innovative approach and consisting of a nodejs core with an extensible and cross-language package and automation platform [Patreon $32/month goal](https://www.patreon.com/aenigma_xmpp)]

## Install

The only supported distros are **Ubuntu 18 [bionic beaver]** and **Debian 9 [stretch]**.

Any distro NOT based on Debian / Ubuntu will currently never work because our framework is entirely and fundamentally designed to work with these distros only. In the future this will change.

```
[log in as root on your target machine]
```

```
apt update
apt install git
```

```
git clone https://github.com/openspace42/aenigma
bash aenigma/setup
```

## Restore a previous install on a fresh new machine:
### [either from S3 or another standalone backup from your old instance]

```
[log in as root on your target machine]
```

```
apt update
apt install git
```

```
git clone https://github.com/openspace42/aenigma
sudo bash aenigma/tools/aenigma-restore
