Hi! This is the website for domain hosted on the aenigma server at hostname!
You're free to use this space to actually host your website [docroot is inside /var/www/domain/htdocs/] or to point your domain to a new server if you whish to do so!
In that case, simply remember to re-run the aenigma installer afterwards, to be guided through the slightly different setup.
Thanks!
